# Term-Deposit-Scheme-Predictive-Model-
This project aims to build a predictive model for a term deposit scheme using various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), decision tree, and random forest.

#  Overview
The term deposit scheme predictive model analyzes a dataset containing information about customers and their responses to marketing campaigns. The goal is to predict whether a customer is likely to subscribe to a term deposit scheme based on the available features.

The project utilizes different machine learning algorithms to train and evaluate models that can accurately predict customer subscriptions to the term deposit scheme. The algorithms considered are logistic regression, KNN, SVM, decision tree, and random forest.

# Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

data: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.

notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation. The notebooks are named according to the algorithm used.

models: This directory stores the trained models in serialized format for future use.

# Libraries Used
The code uses the following Python libraries:

pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: for numerical computing.
matplotlib.pyplot: for data visualization.
seaborn: for statistical data visualization.
scikit-learn: for machine learning algorithms.

# Models Implemented
The following machine learning models are implemented and evaluated:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
